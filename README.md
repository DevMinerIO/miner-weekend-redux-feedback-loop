# Project Name
Redux-Feedback

## Description
Duration: 12ish hours. Slow and steady, really focused on understanding the concepts of Redux. 

This project was about getting feedback inputs from Prime students on how their day was, and sending it to a database. This includes having client validation in order to make sure the inputs fit the parameters of primes numbering scale of 1-5.

Node, React, Redux, HTML, JS
